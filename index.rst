Welcome to Cinfony's documentation!
===================================

**Cinfony** presents a common API to several cheminformatics toolkits. It uses the Python programming language, and builds on top of **Open Babel**, **RDKit**, the **CDK**, **Indigo**, **JChem**, **OPSIN** and cheminformatics webservices.

It's open source so you can install it now for free on Windows? or Linux?. Or you can use it online through the Interactive Cheminformatics Tutorial (Windows only).
